# PRODCOM-Analysis

The PRODCOM database contains data about the total production of chemicals of the countries in the European Union as well as of the whole European Union. However, many chemicals are not listed in this database which results in the fact that the available data is rather an indication of the trend of the total production. This trend and the distribution of the chemical production among the countries in the European Union can be monitored with this app. 

There is **one** required data set and **one** optional data set to run this application (in the *example_data* folder there are example data to test the application):
1. Total production data for selected substances in a selected time period (*DS-066342.sav*)
2. Data set with identification codes for substances from the total production data which should be monitored (*test_codes.xlsx*)

Where to download the actual data is explained in the app. When problems occur you can cotact me via email (schallajasper@gmail.com)

Here are some examples for possible plots which can be generated:
